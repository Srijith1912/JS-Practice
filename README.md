# JS-Practice
A repository to track my JavaScript learning journey.

## Progress Log
- **Day 1 (May 30)**:
  - Read: freeCodeCamp “JavaScript Basics” (up to “Use Conditional Logic with If Statements”) + ES6 scoping + async/await theory (1 hour).
  - Coding: Practiced ES6 features and wrote custom Promise/async/await functions (walkAnimal with chaining, await, parallel execution, and error handling) (45 min).
  - Certification: Completed challenges up to “Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords” in ES6 (~20–25 challenges total) (1.5 hours).
  - **Files**: `es6_practice.js`
